REVERSE DIFFUSION

Forward process (you already did):

xₜ = √ᾱₜ x₀ + √(1 − ᾱₜ) ε

Reverse process tries to undo this, step by step:

We want to sample:

xₜ₋₁ ~ p(xₜ₋₁ | xₜ)

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) gives a closed form where the mean depends on the predicted noise:
- μₜ(xₜ) = (1/√αₜ) [ xₜ − (βₜ / √(1−ᾱₜ)) ε_θ(xₜ,t) ]

And the reverse step is:

xₜ₋₁ = μₜ + σₜ z, where z ~ N(0, I)

At t=0: no noise is added (just take the mean).

That’s literally it.
