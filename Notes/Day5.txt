By the end of today you will have:

✅ dihedral_angles() implemented (the “twist” angle between planes)

✅ a safe ML encoding: sin(angle) and cos(angle) (super important)

✅ an inpainting mask generator (mask a contiguous region per protein)

✅ dataset batches that include:

angles_sin_cos

inpaint_mask

visible_mask (what the model is allowed to see)

✅ a test script that prints shapes + sanity checks


Part A - dihedral_angles

Why distances/vectors aren't enough

- distances tell you how far apart residues are
- bind vectors tells you direction between residues
but proiteuns also care about how the chain twists
