hy this function exists (big picture)
1) Scale invariance

Proteins can be:

large

small

compact

extended

Diffusion models work better when:

inputs live on a consistent numerical scale

2) Training stability

If one protein has RMS ≈ 5 and another ≈ 50:

gradients differ wildly

optimization becomes unstable

Normalizing scale:

keeps numbers near 1

improves conditioning

3) Analogy you can say out loud

Centering removes where the protein is.
Scaling removes how big the protein is.

Together:

translation invariance

scale invariance

One-sentence summary you should memorize

This function rescales each protein so its average distance from the origin is one, ignoring padding, which stabilizes diffusion by removing arbitrary size differences.
