goal 
- understand what gerometic features proteins actually care about
- know why diffusion models cant just use raw uyz coordinates
- implement functions to compute:
    - pairwise distances
    - backbone bond vectors
    - backbone angles
- add a clean geometry.py module
- integrate geometry features with your dataset


why geometry matters here
- raw XYZ coordinates are not enough because if you rotate
the protein model in space, its the same protein biologically 
but a diffrent one numerically, coordinates mixed up

what to do to fix this

Instead of caring about absolute position, proteins care about:

Distances (how far atoms are from each other)

Angles (how bonds bend)

Relative directions

These are rotation-invariant or equivariant, which means:
- rotating the protein doesn’t break the meaning
- This is the foundation of SE(3)-equivariant models

What geomtery are we computing

- pairwise distances
- backbone bond vectors
- local direction features

later 
- full phi/psi dihedrals 
- energy terms
- rosetta-style scoring
